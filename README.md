# ENGS-65-Final-Project

Objective: to model the effect of disturbances to the system of kelp, otters, and urchins in the ocean, create a model of ecosystem relationships. We will be modeling predator prey relationships, nutrient cycling, and climate effects. The model will interrogate the effects of shocks to the system (including sediment deposition, nutrient depletion, sea temperature rise, population depletion) and look at the result of those shocks in terms of species population and climatic effects.
